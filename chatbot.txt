The Bahima people of Southern Uganda, from its first encounter with the British colonial
state, have demonstrated the contradictions inherent in its policy of indirect rule and the theories of
state underpinning it. The Bahima were nomadic pastoralists with herds numbering in the hundreds,
from which it produced quantities of milk, butter, and meat enough to support a gendered division
of labor without agriculture. The first recorded encounters between the Bahima and the British,
published in vast exploratory surveys, remarked on the physical characteristics of the Bahima—tall,
slender frames; thin noses; and light skin—as evidence of their being a colonizing Nilo-Hamitic
people.
Indeed, John Speke, on his famed excursion to the source of the Nile, went as far as to
assert the Bahima considered themselves a colonizing race of foreigners, with the “reigning kings
[retaining] a singular traditional account of their having once been half white and half black” (Speke,
1868: 242). These first records also highlighted the customs of the Bahima, which, the British
believed, made them particularly adaptable to indirect rule. These early ethnographers noted that the
Bahima considered the land on which they grazed their herds of little value, placing stock, rather, in
the number of their stocks.
James Meldon, a captain on the Abyssinia-Uganda expedition, remarked
that the Muhima man is “born in apathy and listlessness, goes through life calm and unruffled, and
nothing...can shake him of his self-sufficient complacency...work is out of the question, the only
form of occupation he will undertake is looking after cattle” (Malden, 1907: 141). This view of the
Bahima—rooted in the “bovine mystique,” to borrow a phrase from Lesotho scholarship—
emphasized their irrational relationship to their herds and their seemingly supernatural ability to
extract value from their irrational husbandry. John Roscoe, another early ethnographer, noted that
“should a (Bahima man’s) favorite cow die, their grief is extreme, and cases are not wanting in which
